# The same as above: if you have more than one device, you will want to
# override this in your device config to add a serial number, e.g.
#
#   serial_number = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
#   fastboot_command = fastboot -s %(serial_number)s

# Of course, in the case you override both adb_command *and* fastboot_command,
# you don't need to specify `serial_number` twice.

# Working directory for temporary files. By default, the usual place for LAVA
# images will be used.
#
# This is useful when the lava dispatcher is controlling the device under test which is
# physically plugged to other machines by setting adb_command to something like
# "ssh <phone-host> adb" and fastboot_command to something like "ssh
# <phone-host> fastboot". adb and fastboot always operate on local files, so
# you need your local files to also be seen as local files on the host where
# adb/fastboot are executed.
#
# In this case, you should set shared_working_directory to a shared directory
# between the machine running the dispatcher and the machine where the phone is
# plugged.  This shared directory must have the same path in both machines.
# For example, you can have your /var/tmp/lava mounted at /var/tmp/lava at
# <phone-host> (or the other way around).
